This repository contains code for mapping pain scores from the FLACC and/or Wong-Baker Faces pain scales to utility values. The code was developed for a study conducted as part of the ARON trial, involving acutely ill children aged 6 months to 12 years in Belgian primary care. 

The repository includes four econometric models used for mapping:

1. Generalized Ordered Logit (Gologit) Model
2. Bayesian Network Model
3. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression
4. Random Forest Regression
Each model explores the relationship between non-preference-based pain scores (FLACC, WB Faces) and utility values, with different approaches for handling the data. Model performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are included for evaluation.

The code is designed to be adaptable across various datasets, with detailed instructions on how to implement the mapping algorithms.
